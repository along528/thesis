Thoughts on signal region descriptions:
-I have some text describing in detail the motiviation for some of these distributions,
but they are showing up too late. Perhaps I could put them next to the list of 
cuts, or just replace the list with these descriptions. 
-The efficiency plots are not shown for all of the distributions considered. In particular
there is no distribution showing the efficiency on the Z window. I should show this as
I think I have it lying around. Or I could just recompute them. I could also just
treat these  plots as examples and not try to make this description so detailed.
-The fiducial cross-section description is now immediately following the signal
selection and optimization description. Is that what I want? Regardless, the description
needs revision.
-Where should the signal yield plots, tables, and cutflows go? along with the description of these?
Just after the event selection? In a new section?
-Could I include more plots to motivate the optimization selection like I did for the 
zwindow and met cuts?


Things to include:
Plots visualizaing optimization
