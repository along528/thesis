\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model (SM) is a theory which describes all of the
observed matter and interactions in the universe, except for gravity.
It is built from a quantum field theory where the consitutent particles
and interactions fit into a non-Abelian 
$\suthree\times\sutwo\times\uone$~gauge symmetry.
From these symmetries come the matter fermions, split 
into the quarks and leptons, and the force-carrying bosons
that mediate their interactions.
The \suthree~symmetry describes the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
which explains the interaction of the quarks via the gluons, the
gauge bosons that mediate the strong force.
The remaining $\sutwo\times\uone$~symmetry 
describes the Electroweak (EW) theory which explains
the interactions of the quarks and leptons via the 
electroweak gauge bosons that mediate
the electroweak force: $W$, $Z$, and $\gamma$ (i.e. the photon).
The EW theory is itself a unified description of the weak force,
involving the $W$ and $Z$, and the electromagnetic force, involving
just the photon.
The $W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons (as well as the quarks and leptons) receive
their non-zero masses through the process of electroweak symmetry
breaking (EWSB). The simplest form of EWSB
introduces an additional 'Higgs' field that
predicts a single new fundamental scalar boson. This boson is the
famous Higgs boson which was discovered recently at the LHC, thereby
confirming this last component of the SM.
%cite

All of the 
observed fundamental 
matter particles in the universe are described by the quark
and leptons of the SM. Their properties are listed 
in \tab\ref{tab:theory_fermions}. 
The particles can be distinguished
by their charges and their masses.
The charges describe how (and if) the particles participate in
different interactions.
Those fermions with electric charge (all but the neutrinos) 
participate in the electromagnetic
interactions. The quarks have color charge (sometimes 
just called color), which allows them to 
participate in the QCD interactions. All fermions also participate in 
the weak interactions. The types of allowed weak interactions are determined
by a combination of the electric charge as well as the weak isospin
and weak hypercharge, described later.
%explain better
Since all of the particles are fermions, they all have a spin of 1/2.
The masses of the particles are not predicted by the theory, but 
are essential for understanding their stability and decay properties
as well as their kinematic behavior.
Each particle also has a corresponding anti-particle with the same mass but
whose electric charge has opposite sign. The neutrinos, with zero 
electric charge, could possibly be their own 
anti-particle (so-called Majorana fermions), but
this has yet to be confirmed.

\end{table}

The quarks and leptons can each be divided up into three ``generations'' composed of pairs
of particles with identical charges but whose masses increase with each generation.
The generations are labeled in \tab\ref{tab:theory_fermions}. 
In the leptonic sector, leptons only interact exclusively with leptons of their own generation.
However, in the quark sector, while there is a strong preference for the quarks to interact
within the same generation, it is still possible for quarks to interact with quarks of 
the other generations. This is described by the CKM matrix... %elaborate
Even though there are three 
generations in both the lepton and quark sectors, 
the quarks and leptons are not observed to interact directly, 
thus the quark and lepton generations should be thought of as separate.


The SM can be written down using a lagrangian of the form
\begin{equation}
\curlyl_{\textrm{SM}} = \curlyl_{\textrm{QCD}} + \curlyl_{\textrm{EW}} + \curlyl_{\textrm{EWSB}}
\end{equation}
which is gauge invariant or something...
From this, one can calculate all of the fundamental interactions of the SM.
As written, the SM lagrangian can be split up into separate terms describing the
QCD, EW, and EWSB behavior. 
The EWSB term includes the behavior related to fermion mass generation.
The details of each term are described in more detail below.

\subsection{The \dubya~Boson}
Of most interest to the topic of this thesis is the behavior and properties
of the \dubya~boson, the charged gauge boson of the EW theory.
The \dubya~was first discovered in 1983 via $p\overline{p}$ collisions
at the SPS by looking at its decay to an electron %abbreviation?
and electron neutrino (cite).
Its mass has been measured in $p\overline{p}$ collisions at the Tevatron
and in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at LEP to give a world 
average of $80.385 \pm 0.015\GeV$~\cite{PDG:2014}, consistent
with the prediction of the mass from \eqn\eqref{}
using values for sin2,alpha,Gf of \_\_\_.
A summary of the \dubya~mass masurements is shown in \fig\ref{fig:theory_wmass}.
The width assuming a Breit-Wigner distribution has also been measured 
at LEP and the Tevatron with an average value 
of $2.085\pm0.042\GeV$ \cite{PDG:2014}. %what about the LHC ?

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Summary of \dubya~mass meassurements.}
\label{fig:theory_wmass}
\end{figure}

Roughly 1/3 of of the time the \dubya~decays approximately 
evenly into each of the three lepton generations,
as expected from lepton universality.
The leptonic decays of the \dubya~result in a charged lepton 
with the same charge as the parent \dubya~(as dictated by charge conservation)
and a neutrino (or anti-neutrino if the parent \dubya~has negative charge).
Thus, the allowed leptonic decays are of the form:
\begin{align*}
W^{-} &\rightarrow l^{-} \overline{\nu}_l \\
W^{+} &\rightarrow l^{+} \nu_l
\end{align*}
The \dubya~decays into quarks the remaining 2/3 of the time with a positively
(negatively) chared \dubya~decaying into a up-type quark (anti-quark) and 
and down-type anti-quark (quark) as determined by charge conservation as follows:
\begin{align*}
W^{+} &\rightarrow q_u \overline{q}_d \\
W^{-} &\rightarrow \overline{q}_u q_d
\end{align*}
The \dubya~decay prefers decays into quarks/anti-quark pairs of the same generation.
However, quark universality is partially in the weak charged interactions, with
a slight mixing of the interactions between the three generations. The 
degree of mixing is described by the CKM matrix (cite) which has been
determined experimentally.  In general, this mixing of the three quark 
generations does not preserve CP symmetry. (define?) Indeed, small CP
violating effects were first observed in the weak interactions in 1964
by looking at the properties of kaon decays (cite, confirm wording).
The measured branching fractions for the \dubya~are 
summarized in \tab\ref{tab:theory_wdecay}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|c}
Decay Mode &  Branching Fraction [\%]\\
\hline
$e^+\nu_e$ ($e^-\overline{\nu}_e$) & $10.71 \pm 0.16$ \\
$\mu^+\nu_{\mu}$ ($\mu^-\overline{\nu}_{\mu}$) & $10.63 \pm 0.15$\\
$\tau^+\nu_{\tau}$ ($\tau^-\overline{\nu}_{\tau}$) & $11.38 \pm 0.21$\\
Quarks & $67.41 \pm 0.27$\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Measured branching fractions of the $\dubya^+$ ($\dubya^-$)~boson 
as reported by the Particle Data Group \cite{PDG:2014}.  The $W$ decays
to quarks result in hadronic states which in general prohibit
one from determining the specific $W$ final state. Thus, only 
an inclusive branching fraction is listed for the decay to quarks.}
\label{tab:theory_wdecay}
\end{table}


The cross-section of the production of the \dubya~at colliders
depends on the initial state (i.e. $pp$ vs $p\overline{p}$) and on the
collision energy. 
The cross-section times branching fraction to leptons 
has been measured at Phenix (RHIC?) (cite), the SPS (cite), the Tevatron
(cite) and most recently at the LHC at 7~\TeV (cite), 8~\TeV (cite), 
and 13~\TeV(cite). A summary of these measurements is shown in 
\fig\ref{fig:theory_wxsec} and is shown to be in good agreement with 
the predictions.

\label{fig:theory_feynman_couplings}
\end{figure}

The non-Abelian character of the 
EW theory of \sec\ref{sec:theory_ew} predicts interactions
between the EW gauge bosons. These interactions are restricted
to the triple gauge coupling (TGC) interactions ($WWZ$ and $WW\gamma$)
and the quartic gauge coupling (QGC) interactions ($WWZZ$, $WWZ\gamma$,
$WW\gamma\gamma$, and $WWWW$). Their feynman diagrams 
are shown in \fig\ref{fig:theory_feynman_couplings}.
Neutral interactions that do not include the \dubya~(like $ZZ\gamma\gamma$ or $ZZZ$)
are not allowed because... %look in electroweak book

Measurements sensitive to $WW\gamma\gamma$
have been performed at LEP (cite), the Tevatron (cite), and the LHC (cite); 
%mention how they were probed?
to $WWZ\gamma$ at LEP (cite)
and the Tevatron (cite); to $ZZ\gamma\gamma$ at LEP (cite); 
and to $WWWW$ at the LHC. Typically, these studies are performed
by looking at x final state (more detail). 
The first measurements sensitive to the $WWWW$ vertex focused on 
same-sign $WW$ vector boson scattering because...


What about TGC measurements?

\subsection{$WWW$ Production}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Feynman diagrams for $WWW$ production.}
\label{fig:theory_feynman_www}
\end{figure}

In this thesis, we are interested in the inclusive production of three
$W$ bosons from proton-proton collisions:
$pp\rightarrow\- \Wp\Wp\Wm+X$ and $pp\rightarrow \Wp\Wm\Wm\allowbreak +X$, 
where $X$ is intended to refer to the fact that no requirements are 
placed on additional particles produced in the hard interaction.
This is sensitive both
to the $WWWW$ coupling (non-resonant production) 
and to associated Higgs production (sometimes referred to as
``Higgsstrahlung'') where the Higgs decays to two
$W$ bosons (resonant production). 
The relevant
tree-level feynman diagrams for this production process are shown in 
\fig\ref{fig:theory_feynman_www}.
The Higgs decay results in one $W$ boson being produced off-shell,
$H\rightarrow WW^*$, making this the leading contribution to off-shell
production.  
The resonance from the Higgs can clearly be seen from the 
distribution of $m_{\Wp\Wm}$ taken from the simulation of production \www~events
in \fig\ref{fig:mww_higgs}.

%It would be nice to show a plot of the Higgs stuff. maybe I can
%steal this and make my own later...
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{figures/2l2j/mWW-parton.pdf}
\caption{ Invariant mass distribution of two opposite-sign $W$ bosons 
in \www events generated with VBFNLO at LO. The Higgs mass peak is clearly 
visible at 126~GeV. (make a better plot)}
\label{fig:mww_higgs}
\end{figure}



The cross-section for this process can be computed at 
next-to-leading-order (NLO) in QCD
( $O(\alpha_s^2)$ in perturbation theory (?) ). Using 
the \madgraph~generator finds an inclusive cross-section of 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(pp\rightarrow WWW + X) = 241.47 \pm 0.13~\textrm{fb}
\end{equation}
where the uncertainty is purely statistical.
The contribution from resonant production is computed separately
and found to make up about 64\% of the 
total inclusive cross-section.
More details on the determination of the signal cross-section, uncertainties,
and kinematics are presented in \sec\ref{sec:signal}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.8]{figures/branching_fractions.png}
\caption{Pie chart showing the different decay modes contributing 
to the total \xsec for the \www~process. 
The dotted areas indicate the portion of each decay 
mode which is due to the production of tau leptons.}
\label{fig:branching_fractions}
\end{figure}

Due to the short lifetime of the $W$ boson, each of the $W$ bosons
in the $WWW$ process will decay before reaching the detector.
This results in a measurable final state for the $WWW$ production 
process that includes some combination of leptons 
and quarks (manifested as jets).  The branching fractions for 
the $WWW$ process can be determined from the individual $W$ branching fractions
listed in \tab\ref{tab:theory_wdecay}.  The expected $WWW$ branching
fractions are thus summarized in the pie chart in \fig\ref{fig:branching_fractions}.
For this thesis, we are primarily interested in the final state
where each $W$ boson decays leptonically (the fully-leptonic final state) 
which has the smallest branching fraction at roughly 3.5\%.
In fact, since the $\tau$ leptons are also unstable, we choose to 
omit $W$ decays to $\tau$ leptons from our fully-leptonic
definition as well. This further reduces the fully-leptonic 
branching fraction to 0.97\%.  While small, this fully-leptonic final state
should have smaller backgrounds to the signal than the other 
decay channels, making it one of the most sensitive channels for studying
this process.


\section{Effective Field Theory}
\subsection{Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings}
%be sure to add a review of measurements

A measurement
of the production rate can be used to probe the gauge couplings, in
particular, the process is sensitive to quartic gauge couplings. The
{\sc VBFNLO } code has implemented a list of higher order operators
that parameterize the effects of new physics at energy scale beyond
the reach of current collider experiments.  The effective field theory
approach is practical and widely used when there is no compelling
specific model of new physics beyond the SM, see for example,
discussions in Refs:~\cite{Hagiwara:1993ck}, \cite{Buchmuller:1985jz}
and \cite{Eboli:2006wa}.  As a benchmark, we choose two gauge
invariant dimension-8 operators:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{s,0} = [(\mathrm{D}_\mu\phi)^\dag\mathrm{D}_\nu \phi]\times [(\mathrm{D}^\mu\phi)^\dag\mathrm{D}^\nu \phi]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{s,1} = [(\mathrm{D}_\mu\phi)^\dag\mathrm{D}^\mu \phi]\times [(\mathrm{D}_\nu\phi)^\dag\mathrm{D}^\nu \phi]
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the Higgs field doublet, and $\mathrm{D}_\mu$ is the covariant derivative. 
The Lagrangian of the effective field theory is thus: 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{eff} = \mathcal{L}_{SM} + \frac{f_{s0}}{\Lambda^4}\mathcal{L}_{s,0}+\frac{f_{s1}}{\Lambda^4}\mathcal{L}_{s,1}
\end{equation}
The choice of the two operators is introduced to benchmark possible
deviations from the SM. If a significant excess of events is 
observed in the data, the parameterization will be changed, to incorporate 
more operators, to
investigate the nature of the observed new physics.
% Once statistically significant
% deviation is observed, of course, more operators should be considered
% for investigating the nature of the observed new physics.
