\chapter{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

%Here I need to go through and describe all of the things that are important for the discussion
%aim for 20 pages

%things to discuss include:
%- A general introduction to the standard model (probably no more than a page or two)
%- Electroweak physics
%- W decay
%- parton distribution functions (maybe with some thorough discussion on this)
%- WWW production
%- Effective field theory and anomalous coupling measurements
