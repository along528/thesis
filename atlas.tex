\chapter{The ATLAS Detector}
\label{sec:atlas}
%step through each section of the atlas detector
%could spend more time on the muon spectometer (like the new EE A-side detectors)
%and more time on the muon trigger
%clare put in the minimal detail (no more than 20 pages) while Jeremy had 50 pages
%I could maybe fit somewhere in between

%need to define Muon Spectrometer (MS)
%need to define Inner Detector (ID)
%need to define Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EM)
%Assumptions:
%Will describe trigger


%I need to define things here like eta, pt, deltaR, etc 
%I may need to talk about isolation here
\cite{ATLAS}


\section{Inner Dector}
\section{Calorimeters }
\section{Muon Spectrometer}
%do i want to talk about muon reconstruction?
%definitely mention muon resoltuion
\section{Trigger}
