\caption{Distributions showing the observed data compared to the background estimate at event pre-selection.}
\label{fig:preselection}
\end{figure}
The signal plus background model 
(described in detail in \sec\ref{sec:bg_estimates})
is compared to data at pre-selection, defined in \sec\ref{sec:preselection},
for a few different kinematic distributions 
in \fig\ref{fig:preselection}. In the upper plot of each distribution,
the colored histograms 
represent the different categories contributing to the signal 
plus background model and 
are split by color based on the category. 
%The colors are...
Hashed bands are shown on the stacked
histograms representing the size of the systematic uncertainties 
on the model, described in \sec\ref{}.
The data is shown in the black points where the 
bars on the points represent the statistical uncertainty on the data.
The lower plot shows the ratio of the data over the model.
In this case, the error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty
on the ratio due to both the data and the model. The red band
shows the size of the systematic uncertainties with respect to the model.
The model is said to be consistent with the data
if the ratio is consistent with unity after considering statistical
and systematic uncertainties.
The different distributions are chosen primarily because 
of their potential to discriminate between signal and background. 
From top to bottom and left to right,
these distributions are: the leading, subleading, and minimum lepton \pt~(ordered by their \pt),
\MET, \deltaphi, $m_{\textrm{SFOS}}$, \njet, \nbjet, and $N_{\mu}$.
In general, the signal plus background model is observed to be consistent
with the data at the pre-selection, at least for those distributions
considered here.

The most important systematic uncertainties 
(discussed in section~\ref{sec:systematics}) are shown, 
namely from the fake estimates and the uncertainties on the WZ and ZZ k-factors.}
\label{fig:preselection_nsfos}
\end{figure}

Upon splitting the pre-selection region based on the number of SFOS
pairs, we end up with signal and background predictions like in 
\fig\ref{fig:preselection_nsfos}, where we can see differences
in the branching fraction for the signal to each of the three signal regions.
In the 0 and 2 SFOS regions, roughly 2.5 signal events are predicted
whereas closer to 5 signal events are predicted in the 1 SFOS region. 
Totaling about 10 signal events predicted at the pre-selection stage.
Shifting to looking at the background, perhaps the most striking 
feature of this plot is the 
clear difference in background yield and background composition
between the 0 SFOS region and the 1 and 2 SFOS regions.
More than 1000 background events are predicted in both the 1 and
the 2 SFOS regions, while only about 30 background events are
predicted in the 0 SFOS region.
Apparently then, the advantage of splitting the signal region based on this
classification comes when looking at the background, specifically the
electroweak $WZ$ and $ZZ$ backgrounds where SFOS lepton pairs may be
produced from the decay of the $Z$ boson(s). Consider only the case
where the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ decay to either $e$ or $\mu$.  The $WZ$ production
process is thus characterized by 3 leptons with at least 1 SFOS lepton pair
which comes from the $Z$. If all three leptons from the $WZ$ decay have been
reconstructed, then there is a 50~\% chance the third lepton 
will also be able to form a SFOS pair with one of the leptons from the $Z$ decay.
Thus, the WZ background will split evenly between the 1 and 2 SFOS classification.
Something similar occurs for the ZZ background except that the fourth lepton 
in the decay must be lost (usually due to possessing a low $\pt$).
The large cross-section for theses processes means that
they become the dominant backgrounds in the 1 and 2 SFOS regions.  
The 0 SFOS signal region is mostly spared from contamination  by 
these large processes but still
includes both the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ processes as background due to the
non-negligible (albeit small) effect of mis-measurement of the lepton
charge, see section~\ref{sec:chargeMisID}.  The 0 SFOS signal region
is thus unique in having a small background which is almost entirely
reducible and dominated instead by events where a jet is mis-measured
as or overlaps with a lepton, called the fake lepton background, along
with the aforementioned sub-dominant effect of lepton charge 
mis-identification described in Section~\ref{sec:chargeMisID}.

\subsubsection{Signal Region Yields}
\label{sec:signal_yield}



The selection used in the final signal regions is determined as described in Section~\ref{sec:signal_regions} and is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:signal_selection}. Kinematic distributions are shown for the distribution
that is cut on just before the cut is applied
for each stage of the selection in Figures~\ref{fig:0sfos}, \ref{fig:1sfos}, and \ref{fig:2sfos} for
the 0, 1, and 2 SFOS regions, respectively.
Cut-flows showing the weighted cut-flows at each stage of the signal selection are shown for the 0, 1, and 2 SFOS regions
in Tables ~\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_0sfos}, ~\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_1sfos}, ~\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_2sfos}.
Unweighted cut-flows are shown in appendix~\ref{sec:app_signal_selection}.

%Tables summarizing the event yields after the final
%selection and binned by the lepton flavor combinations are shown in Tables \ref{tab:0sfos}, \ref{tab:1sfos}, and \ref{tab:2sfos}.




\subsubsection{0 SFOS Signal Region}

The cut-flows for the selection in the 0 SFOS region are shown in Table~\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_0sfos}
while the distributions at each stage of the selection are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:0sfos}.
This is the most sensitive channel with an expected signal to background ratio of 56\%.
The data is observed to agree with the expectation within statistical uncertainties. The background
is ultimately dominated by fake background contributions, which themselves have a large systematic uncertainty
that is similar in size to the statistical uncertainty. This is described in more detail in section~\ref{sec:systematics}.
The Poisson probability of observing 5 events with 3.67 events expected from the signal plus background prediction is 14.1\%.

\subsubsection{1 SFOS Signal Region}
The cut-flows for the selection in the 1 SFOS region are shown in Table~\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_1sfos}
while the distributions at each stage of the selection are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1sfos}.
This region is not as sensitive as the 0 SFOS region with a signal to background ratio of about 9.2\%.
The background is overwhelmingly dominated by $WZ$ contributions. The observed data is slightly discrepant
from the overall prediction, but is about 1 sigma if considering systematics, as demonstrated later in Table~\ref{tab:sys_summary}.
The difference is observed to come almost entirely from the $ee\mu$ region, while the $e\mu\mu$ region shows good agreement, as can
be seen in the bottom right of Figure~\ref{fig:1sfos}. From Figure~\ref{fig:1sfos} we can also see that the agreement
is quite good at each stage of the selection until the cut on the jet multiplicity (bottom middle of Figure~\ref{fig:1sfos}) where the 0 and 1 jet
bins are kept but the 1 jet bin is discrepant.  This suggests that the discrepancy comes from this cut.  This was investigated further
for the different lepton flavor combinations in appendix~\ref{sec:app_signal_selection}.  The efficiencies for the predictions
are very similar for the jet multiplicity cut between the two lepton flavor bins. However, there is a smaller efficiency observed
in the data in the $ee\mu$ bin.  This suggests that the difference is most likely due to a statistical fluctuation.
The Poisson probability of observing 13 events with 16.14 events expected from the signal plus background prediction is 7.9\%.

\subsubsection{2 SFOS Signal Region}
The cut-flows for the selection in the 2 SFOS region are shown in Table~\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_2sfos}
while the distributions at each stage of the selection are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2sfos}.
Even though, the expected background is lower in this region than in the 1 SFOS region, this is the least sensitive signal region 
due to a similar signal efficiency in this region as compared to the 1 SFOS region.
The signal to background ratio is 5.8\% with the dominant background being due to $WZ$, similar to the 1 SFOS region.
There is a fairly large discrepancy observed between the total prediction and the data in this region that is (possibly)
about 2-3 sigma if considering systematic uncertainties reported in Table~\ref{tab:sys_summary}.
The discrepancy is similar for both the $eee$ and $\mu\mu\mu$ lepton flavor combinations as can be seen in the bottom
right of Figure~\ref{fig:2sfos}. If we examine the other distributions of Figure~\ref{fig:2sfos} we see that
the discrepancy begins to appear at the cut on $E_{T}^{Miss} > 55$~GeV. The $E_{T}^{Miss}$ distribution is shown in the
top right of Figure~\ref{fig:2sfos} before the cut is applied. Here we can see that the prediction shows reasonably good
agreement with the data, with only 2 bins showing a discrepancy larger than 1 sigma from the statistical uncertainty. However,
after the cut on $E_{T}^{Miss}$, one of these discrepant bins ends up being the highest contribution to the overall estimate, thus
enhancing the disagreement. This suggests that the disagreement may just be due to a statistical fluctuation.
The Poisson probability of observing 6 events with 10.86 events expected from the signal plus background prediction is 5.7\%.

\subsubsection{Signal Efficiency and Fiducial Cross-sections}
\label{sec:signal_efficiency}

The signal efficiency, $\varepsilon_i$, is defined for each channel, $i$,
as the ratio of the number of expected signal events measured
at the reconstruction level, $N_i^{\textrm{Signal}}$, over the fiducial cross-section, $\sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i$, times the integrated luminosity:
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_i = \frac{N_i^{\textrm{Signal}}}{\sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i\cdot\int\mathscr{L}~\textrm{d}t}
\end{equation}
Recall that the fiducial cross-sections are presented in Section~\ref{sec:fiducial_cross_section}. Further, the fiducial cross-section definition
does not include the branching fraction from $W\rightarrow\tau\nu$ decays.
We observe by looking at truth information that about 20\% of signal
events reconstructed at truth level contain at
least one $W\rightarrow\tau\nu$ decay. Thus, the signal efficiency
definition includes this level of contamination from these events
even though they do not belong explicitly to our signal definition.
Using the reconstructed signal yields listed above and the fiducial
cross-sections generated using MadGraph
from Table~\ref{tab:fiducial_cross_sections}, we
arrive at the signal efficiencies listed in Table~\ref{tab:signal_efficiencies}.


\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\input{tables/signal_efficiencies.tex}
\caption{Signal efficiencies derived separately for each signal region. Only statistical uncertainties are shown.}
\label{tab:signal_efficiencies}
\end{table}




The fiducial cross-sections are evaluated in both 
the \vbfnlo~and \madgraph~samples mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:signal}.
The predicted fiducial cross-sections at each stage of the selection
are listed for both generators in \tab\ref{}.
The fiducial cross-sections and their
statistical uncertainties 
are summarized in each channel for both generators 
after the entire fiducial selection
in \tab\ref{tab:fiducial_cross_sections}.
They are seen to be in good agreement between both generators.


The derived fiducial cross-sections using the two generators are 
shown in Table~\ref{tab:fiducial_cross_sections}.  The cross-sections are observed
to be in good agreement between the two generators. The MadGraph NLO
fiducial cross-sections are used in the final measurement.
The PDF and scale uncertainties on the fiducial cross-sections
are determined after summing over all three signal regions 
as described earlier in \sec\ref{sec:signal}.
% it would probably be a good idea to include the fiducial cut-flows as well.
