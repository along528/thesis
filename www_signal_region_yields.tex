The optimized signal region selection
described in \sec\ref{sec:optimization} and \sec\ref{sec:signal_regions}
and listed in \tab\ref{tab:signal_selection} is applied 
to the data as well as the signal plus background model.
A plot of the predicted yields for the 
signal plus background, along with systematic uncertainties,
is compared to the data for each signal region
in \fig\ref{fig:sig_yields_nsfos}. A detailed 
breakdown of the predicted yields and overall uncertainties
on each background as well as the signal prediction and observed
data
are presented in \tab\ref{tab:sys_summary}.
A breakdown of the systematic uncertainty contributions
to the signal and the backgrounds in each signal region
are summarized in \tab\ref{tab:sys_breakdown}.
More details are presented about each signal region below.

The prediction from the 0 SFOS signal region at each stage of the selection
is summarized in 
\tab\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_0sfos}
for the signal and background predictions, as well as for the data.
There is also a more detailed set of predictions at each stage for the 
different background sources in 
\tab\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_0sfos_bg}. 
From this, we can clearly see the enormous impact of the 0 SFOS
cut on removing the backgrounds, for the $WZ$ background in particular.
We can also see the strong impact that the \nbjet~and \deltaphi~
cuts have without removing much of the signal.
We can also see the signal plus background predictions as 
compared to the data
for the distribution just before each cut is applied in 
\fig\ref{fig:0sfos}. From this we can clearly see
that the data seems to be well modeled at each stage of the selection.

After the full selection is applied,
the 0 SFOS signal region is found to be the most sensitive of the three
channels, as expected, with a predicted signal to background ratio of 56\%.
This can be seen from \tab\ref{tab:sys_summary}, where the expected signal
is 1.344 compared to an expected background of 2.35. Together they 
combine to give a total prediction of 3.69 signal plus background events. 
The Poisson probability of observing $\leq 5$ events with 3.69 events expected 
from the signal plus background prediction is 30.7\%. 
Thus, we can see that this is in good agreement with the observed 5 events in data
from the statistical uncertainty alone. 

The fake background makes up more than half of the total expected background
prediction, with 1.51 background events predicted from fakes compared to 
2.35 events expected from the total background.  The systematic
uncertainty on the fake background is approaching 100\%.
As can be seen in \tab\ref{tab:sys_breakdown}, this results in the
systematic uncertainty on the total background estimate 
that is approaching 60\%, or roughly the size of the fake
background contribution.
This further increases the compatibility 
of the data with the expectation, but also reduces the sensitivity.

The other backgrounds are less important. The $WZ$ background
is the second largest, coming from charge mis-identification, 
with $0.6176$ events predicted. The uncertainty on the $WZ$
background is dominated by that from the $WZ$ normalization uncertainty,
which is 10\%, and also has a small contribution from the 
charge mis-identification estimate uncertainty.
The $VVV$ contributions is the third largest, predicting 0.1126
with a small uncertainty.
The $ZZ$ background has a similar source and 
uncertainty as the $WZ$, but is about 10 times
smaller in size. The $\ttV$ background contributes even less
and the DPS and $Z\gamma$ backgrounds have
0 contribution within the statistical uncertainties of the MC.

\label{fig:1sfos}
\end{figure}



The 1 SFOS signal region is not as sensitive as the 0 SFOS region, with 
a signal to background ratio of about 9.2\%.
The background is overwhelmingly dominated by $WZ$ contributions. 
Similar to the 0 SFOS region, the predictions and data
at each stage of the 1 SFOS signal region selection are shown in
\tab\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_1sfos}
and 
\tab\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_1sfos_bg}. 
The 1 SFOS requirement leaves much of the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ backgrounds,
but the \z-veto and \MET~cuts
are very effective at removing most of this while keeping the signal.


Again, we can also see the signal plus background predictions as 
compared to the data
for the distribution just before each cut is applied in 
the 1 SFOS region by looking at \fig\ref{fig:1sfos}. 
Here, the distributions again appear to be well modeled
at each stage of the selection.  Looking closer
at the \njet~distribution, we can see that there is a deficit
of data in the $\njet=1$ bin which is kept in the selection
and results in a slight deficit in the prediction. 
Further, if we look at the \nmu~distribution we see that
this deficit seems to fall exclusively in the $\nmu=1$ bin.
A more detailed investigation of the cut-flows
in the individual $\nmu=1$ and $\nmu=2$ bins suggests that 
this is most likely a statistical fluctuation.
Overall, the deficit is not very significant, with the Poisson
probability of observing 13 or less events with 16.16 expected
being 26.2\%.


The fake background is only the second largest background in 
this region, making up about 13\% of the total. Still, even with 
the 10\% uncertainty on the normalization of the dominant $WZ$
background, the fake background uncertainty is the largest
uncertainty on the background estimation, approaching 13\%, as
can be seen in \tab\ref{tab:sys_breakdown}.
The \ttV~ and $VVV$ backgrounds are of a similar absolute size as in
the 0 SFOS region, but the larger overall background makes them
even less important. The DPS and $Z\gamma$ uncertainties
contribute a finite amount to the background within the statistical
uncertainties, but remain negligible.

\end{figure}

The 2 SFOS signal region has a similar background composition as
the 1 SFOS signal regions, since it is also dominated by 
the $WZ$ background.  As a result, the systematic uncertainties
on the signal and background are very similar to the 1 SFOS region.
As can be seen
in
\tab\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_1sfos}
and 
\tab\ref{tab:cutflow_weighted_1sfos_bg},
however,
the overall background prediction
is slightly smaller than the 1 SFOS signal region.
This is 
mainly because the tighter \MET~cut removes more of the $WZ$ background.
The signal and the 
fake background also contributes slightly less to the total
background but this is true
immediately after applying the SFOS requirement, and not
due to the \MET~cut.
The reason can be understood 
as described in \sec\ref{sec:signal_regions}:
there are twice many charge and flavor combinations to produce
1 SFOS pairs as there are 2 SFOS pairs.


From the cut-flow tables we can also see that there is a deficit in the data
compared to the prediction which appears after the \deltaphi~
selection. Looking at the distributions at each cut for 
the 2 SFOS region in \fig\ref{fig:2sfos},
one can clearly see the deficit occurring in the bin
furthest to the right in the $|\deltaphi|$ distribution.
The deficit then propagates through uniformly in the 
\njet~and \nmu~distributions until the final estimate.
Note that the bin where the deficit occurs in the $|\deltaphi|$
distribution is also dominated by the $WZ$ background.
We have verified the modeling of the $WZ$ background
as a function of this quantity in control regions. 
Furthermore, the $|\deltaphi|$ distribution
shows good agreement in the 1 SFOS region at this stage
where it is also dominated by the $WZ$ background.
We have no reason to believe that the modeling of the $WZ$
background should be very different or should 
break down in the 2 SFOS region as compared to elsewhere.
Thus, the deficit is most likely a statistical fluctuation
and not due to a problem in the modeling of the 
background.
The Poisson probability of observing $\leq 6$ events
when 10.86 events are expected is 8.5\%.
Thus, even though this is the largest deviation observed in the signal
regions, it is still within 2 standard deviations (5\%).
