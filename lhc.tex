%LHC - Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \cite{lhc} is
a 27 km circumference collider ring
located at CERN approximately 100 m underground on the 
of French-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland.
Its primary goal is to collide protons at very high energies (
the TeV scale)  similar to energies just a few trillionths of a second (?)
after the big bang.  %
The products of these collisions can 
be observed
by several independent but complementary detectors placed at different
points around the ring in order to probe the mechanism
for EWSB as well as to test and probe for new physics beyond the SM.
Since the dynamics of the collisions are governed by quantum mechanical
processes, the types of collision processes of interest cannot be
produced on demand, but instead occur at random with some
probability.
The probability for these processes is typically very small; thus, they are quite
rare (quote a number).
These processes are also short lived, meaning they do not live long
enough to reach the detector and are instead observed indirectly through their
decays. Since multiple physics processes can have the same decay 
signature, it is not possbile to say with certainty that a given 
collision comes from a specific physics process. Instead, 
we must count the number of observed collisions for a given signature
and compare this to the number expected from the 
quantum mechanical probabilities.  If the observed number differs
from the expected, then it could simply suggest that the theoretical expectation
is not well understood or it could suggest the presence of some new physics
process.
In order to make an adequate statement, we must be able to count
enough collisions of the desired signature (say 10 to 1000 depending on the
signature and its backgrounds) 
such that the statistical uncertainty is low.  This places a demand
on the LHC to produce as many collisions as possible, even of these rare
processes. To accomplish this, the LHC is thus designed to collide
protons at a maximum frequency of 40 MHz, or 40 million times per second!
More details about the LHC and collider physics in general are presented
below.



\section{Collider Physics}

From the persepective
of a particle physicsist studying the products of particle collisions, we 
are interested in collisions produced at the highest possible energies,
measured by the collision center-of-mass energy, and at the highest possible rates, 
measured by the luminosity.
The center-of-mass energy, $E_{\textrm{CM}}$, is the collision energy 
in the rest frame
of the collision. For head-on collisions with both beams at the same
energy, $E$, like at the LHC, this is simply the sum of the energies, 
or $E_{CM} = 2 E$. So, $E_{\textrm{CM}}$ grows linearly as a function
of the beam energy. This is in contrast with fixed target experiements
where $E_{\textrm{CM}} \propto \sqrt{E}$ and thus grows much more slowly. 
Frequently this is related to the Mandelstam variable,
$s$, which is the squared magnitude of the Lorentz four-vectors
of the incoming collision particles $p_1$ and $p_2$ such that
$s = (p_1+p_2)^2 = E_\textrm{CM}^2$.
The high beam energies required prefer a circular collider (as opposed
to a linear collider) so that the particles may be repeatedly 
accelerated at each cycle using the same hardware.
In order to accelerate the particles, they must be both stable (if you
want them to hang around long enough to collide) and charged (so
that they may respond to electromagnetic steering and acceleration).
This leaves just protons and electrons (and their anti-particles)\footnote{It is also
possible to collide heavy ions, such as lead. In fact, the LHC does collide
heavy ions when it is not colliding protons, though that is not the focus of this
thesis.}.
Electrons and positrons are fundamental particles and thus provide
very clean collisions, but their small mass means that they suffer
from high energy losses due to syncrhotron radiation in response to acceleration. 
Too much synchrotron radiation and the beam could lose too much energy
to be practical. 
This decides the overall radius and size of the collider ring, since a smaller
ring means tighter turns and thus more acceleration\footnote{In fact, 
the LHC uses the same tunnel (which was the same size) as 
the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) Collider and which
operated from 1989 to 2000 but only up to energies of 209 GeV for the reasons
described.}.
Protons and anti-protons are much less affected by synchrotron radiation
and thus can be accelerated to higher energies at a circular collider.
To bend the particles around the ring at high beam energies 
requires tremendously strong dipole magnets. 
Thus, the limiting factor for the energy is ultimately the requirements
on the dipole magnets, which must be superconducting and at the cutting-edge 
of current technology.
To get the particles to these very high energies, the particles
are ultimately accelerated using electromagnetic waves in radio-frequnency cavities.
The beam is chopped up into ``bunches'' separated at regular intervals
to synchronize with the amplitude and ``surf'' the wave.  The frequency
of the radio-frequnecy waves thus determines the bunch spacing.

\begin{equation}
N= L\sigma
\end{equation}

Units of $L$ are \lumiunits
For fixed target
\begin{equation}
L = N \rho_n t
\end{equation}

$N$ is the incident rate, $\rho_n$ is the target number
density, $t$ is the target thickness.

For colliding beam
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{N_1 N_2}{A} r_b
\end{equation}
where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of protons per bunch, 
$A$ is the cross-sectional are of the beam, 
and $r_b$ is the crossing rate
\begin{equation}
r_b = n \frac{c}{C}
\end{equation}
$n$ is the number of bunches, $C$ is the circumference of the machine
and $c$ is ...

Or 
\begin{equation}
L=f \frac{N_b^2}{4\pi\sigma^2} R
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the collision frequency, $N_b$ is the number
of particles in a bunch, $R$ is a geometrical factor
taking into account the crossing angle and hourglass effect, 
and $\sigma$ is the transverse size (not cross-section).
$\sigma^2 = \beta^* \varepsilon_N/ \beta\gamma$
where $\beta^*$ is the betatron function (want small), 
$\varepsilon_N$ is the normalized emittance, $\gamma$ is the 
relativistic gamma factor and proportional to energy, $\beta$ is the 
relativistic $\beta$.
LHC design lumi is $10^{34}~\lumiunits$.

useful life of colliding beams is burn rate

luminosity can be increased by making betastar as small as possible
and increasing Nb and epsilone proprotionally
