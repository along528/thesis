Kate and Caitlin (``the Ckaitelyns''), this wouldn't have even gotten off the ground  if you both didn't have the guts to take this journey up to Boston with me.  And you're still stuck up here!  Sorry about that. You can always go back home, but I'd miss you if you did. 
Clare, I owe you so much for taking me under your wing. It's because of you that I had such a great experience in Geneva. Here's to many more in Boston!
Grant, thanks for putting up with me even though I made you feel old. I miss our debates over red wine and reindeer meat.
Bonnie, Grant, Michal, and Michelle, here's to Michal not driving off that cliff in Rapallo while dancing to Daft Punk on the radio. You made my time in Geneva too much fun.
Luke,
John, all these years since I first set up my drums on Painted Tree Rd and we still don't have a band. It probably has something to do with this thing... Sorry about that, but you managed to keep the metal alive without me. Anyway, it's meant so much to me that I can fly down to NC and see you...
Ryan, thanks for keeping the spirit of North Carolina alive in Massachusetts. ...
Jeff, looks like we made it. Look how far we've come my baby. We mighta took the long way. We knew we'd get there someday. They said, ``I bet they'll never make it''. But just look at us holding on. We're still together still going strong. Also, I still hate Garrison Keillor.
Chynna,
Katie,
April,...
Mom, Dad, Paul, Susan, how could I ever truly thank you? I know this at least, I wouldn't have made it anywhere without your love and I would never have made it this far without your belief in me.
Mom,
Dad,
I love you all.
