As was discussed in \sec\ref{sec:theory_www_production}, there are other decay
channels of the $WWW$ process besides the fully-leptonic decay channel,
which was the focus of Chapter \ref{sec:www}.  
In fact, one other decay channel for this process has been studied within 
ATLAS. This is the semi-leptonic channel where \wwwlljj. The details of this 
analysis are beyond the scope of this thesis. We can use the results of this channel,
however, along with those for the fully-leptonic decay channel, to obtain a stronger measurement
on the overall SM $WWW$ total cross-section measurement and limits on the aQGC signal reported than
those reported for just the fully-leptonic 
channel in \sec\ref{sec:measurement} and \sec\ref{sec:aqgc_limit}. 


In this chapter we will first summarize the results of the semi-leptonic study. 
This will be followed by a statistical combination of the fully-leptonic and semi-leptonic
results leading to an improved  
measurement on the SM $WWW$ total cross-section and limits on the 
aQGC signal.

\section{Combined Cross-section Measurement}
\label{sec:combined_measurement}

The combined cross-section measurement is performed to 
measure the total cross-section of the $WWW$ process. 
The same expectation, likelihood, and profile likelihood
ratios in \eqn\eqref{eq:poisson_expectation},
\eqn\eqref{eq:poisson_likelihood}, and
\eqn\eqref{eq:profile_likelihood_ratio}, respectively.
The same methodology for extracting the measured fiducial
cross-section from
\sec\ref{sec:measurement} is used for extracting the combined
cross-section measurement except that the semi-leptonic channel
inputs are included along with the fully-leptonic channel
and that the measurement is extrapolated to the total
cross-section.
For the fully-leptonic channel,
the fiducial cross-section and C-factor inputs 
are taken from \tab\ref{tab:inputs_3l}
while the semi-leptonic channel inputs are taken from 
\tab\ref{tab:inputs_2l2j}.
The combined measurement on the signal strength, $\mu$, is translated
into a measurement on the total cross-section using the relation
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}_{\textrm{Observed}} = \frac{\mu}{A} \sum_{i\in \textrm{Channels}} \sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i
\label{eq:sigmatot}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the total acceptance which is the sum of the 
acceptance in each channel, $A_i$:
\begin{equation}
A = \sum_i A_i
\end{equation}
where $A_i$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
A_i = \frac{ \sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i }{ \sigma^{\textrm{Total}}}
\end{equation}
Where again the $\sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i $ are simply the fiducial
cross-sections in each channel taken from
\tab\ref{tab:inputs_3l} and \tab\ref{tab:inputs_2l2j}
and $\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}$ is the expected total cross-section
in \eqn\eqref{eq:total_www_xsec}, reprinted here for convenience:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}_{\textrm{Theory}}= 241.47\pm0.13 ~(\textrm{Stat.}) ~^{+10.33}_{-6.08} ~(\textrm{PDF}) ~\pm 6.3 ~(\textrm{Scale}) ~\textrm{fb} %uncertainty?
\end{equation}
The acceptance values for both the semi-leptonic and fully-leptonic channels 
are summarized here in \tab\ref{tab:acceptance}.
The total acceptance is found to be $A = 2.547 \times 10^{-3} \pm 0.039 \times 10^{-3}$.

The distribution of $q_0$ is shown 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:stat_measurement_significance} for the combination.  
The observed null p-value 
is found to be 0.1657 ($0.971~\sigma$) with an 
expected of 0.152 ($1.026~\sigma$).

of this line represents the null p-value or the

The dotted black curve shows a $\chi^2$ distribution for 1 degree of freedom with which

The negative log likelihood contour is shown
for the combination of all six channels in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:stat_measurement_interval_combination}.
The expected value and uncertainties for the fiducial cross-section is:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}_{\textrm{Expected}} = 241.47 ~ ^{+232}_{-199} \stat ~^{+152}_{-153}\syst ~\textrm{fb}
\end{equation}
while the observed fiducial cross-section is:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}_{\textrm{Observed}} = 227.03 ~ ^{+202}_{-198} \stat ~^{+154}_{-160} \syst ~\textrm{fb}
\end{equation}

lines pinpoint the location of the $1~\sigma$ and $2~\sigma$ total Gaussian uncertainties

Combined limits on the aQGC signal use the same methodology
as in \sec\ref{sec:aqgc_limit} except that the inputs from the semi-leptonic
channel, described in \sec\ref{sec:semilep}, are included as well.
The resulting one-dimensional limits are listed in \tab\ref{tab:aqgc_combined_1d}
while the two-dimensional limts are shown in \fig\ref{fig:aqgc_combined_2d}.
