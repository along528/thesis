As was discussed in \sec\ref{sec:theory_www_production}, there are other decay
channels of the $WWW$ process besides the fully-leptonic decay channel,
which was the focus of Chapter \ref{sec:www}.  
In fact, one other decay channel for this process has been studied within 
ATLAS. This is the semi-leptonic channel where \wwwlljj. The details of this 
analysis are beyond the scope of this thesis. We can use the results of this channel,
however, along with those for the fully-leptonic decay channel, to obtain a stronger measurement
on the overall SM $WWW$ total cross-section measurement and limits on the aQGC signal reported than
those reported for just the fully-leptonic 
channel in \sec\ref{sec:measurement} and \sec\ref{sec:aqgc_limit}. 


In this chapter we will first summarize the results of the semi-leptonic study. 
This will be followed by a statistical combination of the fully-leptonic and semi-leptonic
results leading to an improved  
measurement on the SM $WWW$ total cross-section and limits on the 
aQGC signal.

\label{sec:semilep}

The semi-leptonic analysis uses a selection that is designed
to select events from the decay channel \wwwlljj. As such, 
it requests exactly two leptons and two jets.  The selection is similar
to the one used the same-sign $WW$ VBF production process of
\cite{PhysRevLett.113.141803} with the main difference being that
it requires $|\Delta y(jj)| < 1.5$ and $65 \GeV < m_{jj} < 105 \GeV$
to separate the $WWW$ signal from the same-sign $WW$ VBF signal as can be
seen in \fig\ref{fig:signal_semilep}. The selection used is listed in \tab\ref{tab:selection_2l2j}.
It splits selection into three separate signal regions based on the final
state lepton flavors: $ee$, $e\mu$, and $e\mu$. The final state leptons
are required to have the same sign.

The signal is generated using \madgraph~with the same setup as in \sec\ref{sec:signal}.
Thus, the total cross-section is the same as in \eqn\eqref{eq:total_www_xsec}.
The fiducial cross-sections are determined in a similar fashion to that in 
\sec\ref{sec:fiducial} but using the fiducial selection listed in \tab\ref{tab:fiducial_selection_2l2j}.
The fiducial cross-section is 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial,Semi-lep}}_{\textrm{Theory}}= 306\pm6.73 ~(\textrm{Stat.}) ~^{+15.3}_{-8.57} ~(\textrm{PDF}) ~\pm 3.05 ~(\textrm{Scale}) ~\textrm{ab} %uncertainty?

The backround is estimated in a similar way to \sec\ref{sec:bg_estimates}. The $WZ$, 
$V\gamma$, and other same-sign ($Z$,$WW$,$ZZ$, $\ttV$, etc) backgrounds are predicted
using MC. The charge mis-identification background is evaluated using a data-driven method
where the rates are derived in a similar way as in \sec\ref{sec:chargemisd_rates}
but are instead applied as weights on the data.
The fake lepton background is also evaluated using the data but uses a form factor method
instead of the generalized matrix method of \sec\ref{sec:mxm}.

The resulting signal and background predictions and overall systematic uncertainties,
as well as the observed data events,
are shown for each semi-leptonic signal region in \tab\ref{tab:yields_2l2j}. Systematics
are determined in the same way as in \sec\ref{sec:systematics} except for the charge
mis-identification backgrounds and fake backgrounds which evaluate different systematics due
to the different estimation methods. The systematics for the semi-leptonic
channel are summarized in \tab\ref{tab:sys_2l2j}. The fiducial cross-sections
and correction factors (like in \eqn\eqref{eq:cfactor}) are presented in \tab\ref{tab:inputs_2l2j}.

\section{Combined Cross-section Measurement}
\label{sec:combined_measurement}

The combined cross-section measurement is performed to 
measure the total cross-section of the $WWW$ process. 
The same expectation, likelihood, and profile likelihood
ratios in \eqn\eqref{eq:poisson_expectation},
\eqn\eqref{eq:poisson_likelihood}, and
\eqn\eqref{eq:profile_likelihood_ratio}, respectively.
The same methodology for extracting the measured fiducial
cross-section from
\sec\ref{sec:measurement} is used for extracting the combined
cross-section measurement except that the semi-leptonic channel
inputs are included along with the fully-leptonic channel
and that the measurement is extrapolated to the total
cross-section.
For the fully-leptonic channel,
the fiducial cross-section and C-factor inputs 
are taken from \tab\ref{tab:inputs_3l}
while the semi-leptonic channel inputs are taken from 
\tab\ref{tab:inputs_2l2j}.
The combined measurement on the signal strength, $\mu$, is translated
into a measurement on the total cross-section using the relation
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}_{\textrm{Observed}} = \frac{\mu}{A} \sum_{i\in \textrm{Channels}} \sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i
\label{eq:sigmatot}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the total acceptance which is the sum of the 
acceptance in each channel, $A_i$:
\begin{equation}
A = \sum_i A_i
\end{equation}
where $A_i$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
A_i = \frac{ \sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i }{ \sigma^{\textrm{Total}}}
\end{equation}
Where again the $\sigma^{\textrm{Fiducial}}_i $ are simply the fiducial
cross-sections in each channel taken from
\tab\ref{tab:inputs_3l} and \tab\ref{tab:inputs_2l2j}
and $\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}$ is the expected total cross-section
in \eqn\eqref{eq:total_www_xsec}, reprinted here for convenience:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\textrm{Total}}_{\textrm{Theory}}= 241.47\pm0.13 ~(\textrm{Stat.}) ~^{+10.33}_{-6.08} ~(\textrm{PDF}) ~\pm 6.3 ~(\textrm{Scale}) ~\textrm{fb} %uncertainty?
\end{equation}
The acceptance values for both the semi-leptonic and fully-leptonic channels 
are summarized here in \tab\ref{tab:acceptance}.
The total acceptance is found to be $A = 2.547 \times 10^{-3} \pm 0.039 \times 10^{-3}$.


\begin{table}[ht!]

\input{tables/combination/acceptances.tex}

in each bin is used to compute the overall acceptance, $A$.

The distribution of $q_0$ is shown 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:stat_measurement_significance} for the combination.  
The observed null p-value 
is found to be 0.1657 ($0.971~\sigma$) with an 
expected of 0.152 ($1.026~\sigma$).
