%there's a fine line between clever and stupid

Within the past six years much has changed in the world of particle physics. The mechanism for electroweak symmetry
breaking was confirmed in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson. At this very moment, tantalizing hints
of new discoveries are appearing. Will this reveal something new and usher in a new era in the 
world of particle physics? We will know soon enough.

Regardless, we must continue to look if we are to realize our own humanity.


%This section should give a general history of the science leading up to modern particle and collider physics

%It should set the stage for the thesis and step through a brief description of what will go 
%into each chapter.  

%I should probably write this last

%Doesn't need to be more than a couple of pages
