The efficiencies for real preselected leptons to pass the tight requirements are measured in data as a function of the lepton $\pt$. The measurement is performed in data samples enriched with real leptons from $Z\rightarrow l^+l^-$ decay with a standard tag-and-probe method. The tag passes all signal lepton selections and is trigger matched, while the requirement imposed to the probe is to satisfy only the lepton pre-selection cuts. Their invariant mass has to be within $Z$-mass window: $m_{ll}\in[80, 100]$~\GeV{}. If both leptons satisfy the tag requirements, they are alternatively considered as the tag in order to avoid any bias introduced by its selection. The invariant mass for two opposite sign same-flavor leptons is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:realEff_CRs}.

The $\pt$ distributions for both the number of probes passing the signal requirements, $n^{\mathrm{Tight}}$, and the total number of probes, $n$, are shown separately in the electron and muon control regions used to derive the rates in Figure~\ref{fig:realEff_CRsPt}.
The efficiency, $\varepsilon_i$, is calculated in each $\pt$ bin, $i$, by taking the ratio of $n_{i}^{\mathrm{Tight}}$ over $n_i$. That is,
\begin{align*}
%\varepsilon_i=\frac{n_T^{\mathrm{probe}}}{n^{\mathrm{probe}}}
\varepsilon_i=\frac{n_{i}^{\mathrm{Tight}}}{n_{i}}
\end{align*}
The final binning of the efficiency is chosen to be coarse enough
to have good statistics in the ratio while also preserving shape information as a function
of $\pt$. 
The final efficiencies determined using both data and MC 
can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:realEff}.

Two sources of systematic uncertainties are taken into account. Firstly, the measurement may be affected by the selection of $20$~\GeV\ $Z$-mass window. It has been thus varied by $5$~\GeV\ and the final effect has been proved to be negligible. Secondly, the measurement is done in Drell-Yan data without any  specific treatment of the other background. Therefore, the difference between the efficiencies measured in data and MC is taken as a systematic.  A summary of the rates measured in
data and MC used to compute the systematic uncertainties are shown for electrons
in Table~\ref{table:realEff_El} and for Muons in Table~\ref{table:realEff_Mu}.

\subsubsection{Fake lepton efficiency}

The fake efficiency represents the probability that a fake lepton satisfying the preselected criteria passes also the signal requirements. 
The measurement, performed separately for each $\pt$ bin, $i$, is performed in fake-enriched samples by looking at the number of probe leptons in data 
passing pre-selection, $n_i$, and comparing to the number which only pass also the tight
selection, $n^{Tight}_i$. Contamination from real leptons, $n^{\mathrm{Real}}_i$ and $n^{\mathrm{Tight}, \mathrm{Real}}_i$, 
and from photon converted leptons, $n^{\mathrm{PC}}_i$ and $n^{\mathrm{Tight},\mathrm{PC}}_i$, 
is corrected using MC by subtracting from the totals.  The rate is then determined as follows:
%\begin{align*}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_i=\frac{n^{\mathrm{Tight}}_i-n^{\mathrm{Tight},\mathrm{Real}}_i-n^{\mathrm{Tight},\mathrm{PC}}_i} {n_i -n^{\mathrm{Real}}_i -n^{\mathrm{PC}}_i }
\label{eq:fakerate}
\end{equation}
%\end{align*}
Since the rates depend on the fake lepton origin, the derivation is done separately for electrons and muons.     

The classification of leptons in MC as being either real or from photon conversion is performed on an event-by-event basis at truth level using the MCTruthClassifier tool~\cite{MCtruthclassifier:twiki}.  
Since this is a di-lepton control region, the majority of events with a real lepton
tag and a probe lepton due to photon conversion comes from the $W\gamma$ process where the photon converted lepton is an electron.
As expected, the number of probe muons coming from photon conversion are observed to be negligible.

Efficiencies are measured from a data set enriched with one tight lepton that passes the signal lepton selections with \pt$>40$~\GeV\ and 
one fake candidate satisfying only the pre-selection criteria defined in tables~\ref{tab:eledef} and~\ref{tab:muondef}. Events with additional loose or tight leptons are rejected. 
The QCD background may also enter these control regions, especially in low \met\ . Therefore, an additional \met$>10$~\GeV\ requirement is introduced. 
In order to reduce the contamination from real processes like $t\bar{t}$, $WW$ and $Z$, the two leptons are required to have the same sign.
Finally, the control regions are split based on the flavor of the tag and probe leptons.  The muon rates are determined in the region
with two muons while the electron rates are determined in the region with a muon tag and an electron probe.  The choice of a muon tag 
in the region used to derive the electron rates is particularly important since allowing electron tags have a large contamination from $Z$ backgrounds.
This is true even after the same-sign requirement because of charge mis-identification.  
The charge mis-identification rate for muons is negligible
and so allows one to use the muon-muon control region for the muon rates, which has the least contamination.
This behavior can be seen in the distributions of probe muon transverse momentum in the same-sign muon-muon tag-and-probe control region used to derive
the muon fake rates shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fakeEff_CRs_muon} while
the distributions of probe electron transverse momentum are shown in the same-sign electron-muon tag-and-probe control region used to derive
the electron fake rates shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fakeEff_CRs_electron}.
The control regions for both electrons and muons are further split based on the number of b-tagged jets in the event, 
which has an effect on the source of the fake leptons.  In particular, requiring b-tagged jets increases the fraction
of fake leptons coming from heavy flavor. Two different sets of control regions were ultimately considered, those
with at least one b-tagged jet and those without any requirement on the presence of b-tagged jets.  The region
with at least one b-tagged jet ($N_{b-jet} > 0$) is used as the central value since it contains more heavy flavor contributions
and so compares better with the signal regions, as described later in Section~\ref{sec:fakecomposition}.  The other is used 
to determine a systematic on the composition, described later.  


A detailed breakdown of the numbers used to compute the fake rates are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_fakebg}.
%would it be useful to show the other di-lepton control regions in an appendix?

Three systematic uncertainties are considered. First, the subtraction of the processes with 
two real leptons ($t\bar{t}V$, $VV$ and $VVV$) using MC prediction introduced an uncertainty on 
their cross-sections. This effect is estimated by varying the MC normalization by $\pm 20$\%.  %should rerun with 5%
We refer to this is as the 'correlated' systematic uncertainty.
Second, given that the extraction regions and the signal regions have different kinematic selections, 
the fake leptons of different origin dominate. This kinematic dependence of fake efficiencies has been estimated 
by modifying the requirements of the sample used for the measurement. In particular, the cut thresholds 
on the $E_{T}^{Miss}$ and tag lepton $\pt$ used
for determining the di-lepton control regions are varied. The $E_{T}^{Miss}$ threshold is 
varied in 5~GeV steps scanning a range of $\pm 10$~GeV around the nominal
threshold of $E_{T}^{Miss} > 10$~GeV while the $\pt$ threshold is varied in 5~GeV steps in a range of $\pm 20$~GeV 
around the nominal threshold of $\pt > 40$~GeV.  When varying the $E_{T}^{Miss}$ cut, the $\pt$ cut
is kept at the nominal threshold and vise-versa. This is referred to as the 'uncorrelated' systematic.
These are determined separately for electrons and muons, since they use different control regions. The 'uncorrelated' and
'correlated' systematics for electrons and muons are then combined together by adding in quadrature on an event-by-event basis.
As a result the uncertainty is presented as a single systematic uncertainty on the fake electron
contribution and a separate single systematic on the fake muon contribution.
The third and final systematic contribution comes from the choice of control region, based on the number of b-tagged
jets, as described earlier.  The nominal control regions for both the electron and muon cases is when 
there is at least one b-tagged jet present.  The difference between the rates for the nominal case
and the region where no requirement is placed on the presence of b-tagged jets is chosen as a systematic.
We have determined that the difference in the composition in these two regions adequately covers the difference
in composition that may be present due to the extrapolation from the control regions to the signal regions. This is 
discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:fakecomposition}.  Another set of control regions was studied
which vetoes any b-tagged jets, but this was observed to give a very large difference in composition which is 
probably too conservative of an estimate to be used as a reasonable systematic.
The rates along with the statistical and systematic uncertainties are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:fakeEff} 
as well as in Tables \ref{table:fakeEff_El} and \ref{table:fakeEff_Mu}.
The final binning of the efficiency is chosen to be coarse enough
to have good statistics in the ratio while also preserving shape information as a function
of $\pt$.

\subsubsection{Study of the fake lepton composition}
\label{sec:fakecomposition}

The use of the generalized matrix method to determine the 
relies on the assumption that the 
fake rates derived in the di-lepton control regions may be extrapolated to the three lepton signal regions.  
The fake rate depends primarily on the source of the fake leptons, thus
one can check the validity of this assumption by looking at the composition of the
different fake lepton sources in the di-lepton control regions and comparing 
them to the
composition in the three lepton signal regions. 

The fake composition is investigated by classifying the MC events as a function of the origin of the fake leptons found in each event.  The MCTruthClassifier tool~\cite{MCtruthclassifier:twiki} is used
to identify the fake laptops origin as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Real - Prompt leptons
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{IsoElectron} 
		\item \emph{IsoMuon}
		\item In $Z\gamma$ events classified as either \emph{UnknownElectron} or \emph{UnknownMuon} and parent of lepton is $\gamma$.
		\item In $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau$ events classified as either \emph{NonIsoElectron} or \emph{NonIsoMuon} and lepton has $\tau$ as parent.
		\end{itemize}
\item Heavy Flavor (HF) - Leptons from heavy flavor jets or heavy hadron decays
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{NonIsoElectron} 
		\item \emph{NonIsoMuon}
		\end{itemize}
\item Light Flavor (LF) -  Leptons from light flavor jets
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Hadron} 
		\item \emph{Others}
		\item In $ZWW$ and $ZZZ$ events classified as either \emph{UnknownElectron} or \emph{UnknownMuon} and parent of lepton is either an up quark, down quark, or a gluon.
		\end{itemize}
\item Photon Conversion (PC)  - Leptons due to radiation
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{BkgElectron} 
		\item \emph{BkgMuon}
		\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

The composition is shown for electrons in the di-lepton control 
regions in Table~\ref{table:CompositionElectronCR} and in the event pre-selection and in region close to the signal regions in Table~\ref{table:CompositionElectronSR}.
First, one can see that the PC contribution is roughly half of the fake contribution
estimate using MC
in the control regions and in the region close to the signal regions. Since this is being estimated
using MC close to the signal regions, 
this component is subtracted out in order to remove any double counting
in the final estimate. Then, after subtraction,
if one compares the composition in the control regions
to the composition in the region close to the signal regions only for electrons, 
in particular after tight selection, one can see that 
the composition is similar for both, 
with about 50 to 75 \% coming from HF and the rest from LF.

For the muons, one can see the composition in the di-lepton control regions in 
Table~\ref{table:CompositionMuonCR} and in the event pre-selection
and region close to the signal regions in Table~\ref{table:CompositionMuonSR}. For the muons the PC
component is negligible, as expected, and there is no need for subtraction.
In this case, the composition is dominated by HF, contributing about 90\% with the
rest coming from LF.  This is true in the region close to the signal regions and in the control regions.

The differences observed in the composition between the inclusive $b-jet$ and $b-jet$ 
tagged di-lepton control regions is observed to be of a similar size
to the difference in the composition for the region close to the signal regions for both the electron 
and muon cases.
Thus, comparing the rates derived in the control regions using the two different
$b-jet$ criteria should take into account any differences in the composition due
to extrapolation. This is the motivation for choosing the difference in these two 
control regions as an additional systematic on the fake rates.

Using this study of the composition, we conclude that the composition appears to be
consistent between the control regions and the region close to the signal regions.  We have chosen 
a comparison of two different di-lepton control regions to be used a systematic
which should take into account any remaining differences in the composition.

It should be said that in the di-lepton control regions, 
the MC estimate strongly underestimates the amount observed
in data, presumably because of additional sources of fakes 
not modeled in our MC, such as from QCD. 
The difference in the estimates can be clearly seen in Figures~\ref{fig:fakeEff_CRs_muon_stacked}
and \ref{fig:fakeEff_CRs_electron_stacked} which show the stacked MC estimate from real, photon conversion,
heavy flavor and light flavor sources compared to data.
Thus, the composition estimates shown are only reliable 
if these additional sources would have a similar composition to the ones observed
in this study that we are able to model. This effectively 
puts a large uncertainty on the composition estimates observed in this study. Also,
because the additional sources are most likely dominated by QCD, the PC 
contribution to these sources should be small. Thus, the PC component before subtraction
is likely overstated as shown in 
Tables~\ref{table:CompositionElectronCR} 
and \ref{table:CompositionElectronSR}.
As discussed earlier, we subtract the PC
component from the data when obtaining the fake rate. This procedure then assumes
explicitly that all of the photon conversion contribution is modeled in MC and is 
small.

\caption{
Composition of fake electrons taken from  MC events in the same-sign electron-muon di-lepton control regions
used to extract electron fake rates. The composition is split as either Heavy Flavor (HF), Photon
Conversion (PC), and Light Flavor (LF) are shown. In the ``PC subtracted'' case, the PC component
has been explicitly removed.  This corresponds to the scenario ultimately used in the
fake rate estimation.
