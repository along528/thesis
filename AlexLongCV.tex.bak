\section*{Research Experience}

\href{http://www.atlas.ch}{{The ATLAS Experiment}, CERN, Meyrin, Switzerland} \newline
Graduate Research Fellow, High Energy Physics, Boston University, \datestamp{2010}{09}{} -- Present \newline
Advisor: Prof. John Butler
{\begin{itemize}
\item Conducting first search of \textit{WWW} production using the fully leptonic decay channel using data collected at the LHC in 2012.
\item Performed search for exotic heavy charged gauge bosons in the leptonic decay channel using data collected from the LHC in 2012. Significantly improves limits from previous searches within ATLAS.
\item Studied the performance of the ATLAS muon trigger system during 
using data collected at the LHC in 2012.  Demonstrated the robustness of the muon trigger system against pileup.
\item Performed timing studies of new fast muon trigger algortihm to 
be used in LHC Run 2.
\item Participated in upgrades and improvements to the ATLAS muon spectrometer system in preparation for LHC Run 2.  Resulted in finally 
bringing the ATLAS muon system to the full Technical Design Report specifications. Also helped in first complete test of the Muon Drift Tube (MDT) gas system.
\item Lead efforts to test custom ASD chips to be used in the MDT 
technology for future upgrades to the ATLAS muon system.
\end{itemize}

Undergraduate Research Assistant, \datestamp{2008}{04}{15} -- \datestamp{2010}{05}{15} \newline
Advisor: Prof. Reyco Henning 
{\begin{itemize}
\item Built a muon veto system for a low background dark matter detector installed in the Kimballton Underground Reasearch Facility.
\item Performed Monte Carlo simulation of cosmogenically activated germanium in High-Purity Germanium detectors.
\item Developed software for use in low-background gamma spectroscopy analysis.
\end{itemize}

Undergraduate Research Assistant, \datestamp{2009}{06}{15} -- \datestamp{2009}{08}{15} \newline
Advisor: Dr. Ji Qiang 
{\begin{itemize}
\item Developed software for the optimization of beam parameters
in the design of the photo-injector for the Next Generation Light Source (NGLS) project at LBNL.
