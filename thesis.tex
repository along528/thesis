%                       PRELIMINARY PAGES
% According to the BU guide the preliminary pages consist of:
% title, copyright (optional), approval,  acknowledgments (opt.),
% abstract, preface (opt.), Table of contents, List of tables (if
% any), List of illustrations (if any). The \tableofcontents,
% \listoffigures, and \listoftables commands can be used in the
% appropriate places. For other things like preface, do it manually
% with something like \newpage\section*{Preface}.

% This is an additional page (do not hand it in at the library) to print
% boxed-in title, author and degree statement so that they are visible through
% the opening in BU covers used for reports. This makes a nicely bound copy.

%\buecethesistitleboxpage

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.
\maketitle

% The copyright page is blank except for the notice at the bottom. You
% must provide your name in capitals.

%\copyrightpage

% Now include the approval page based on the readers information

\approvalpage

% The acknowledgment page should go here. Use something like
% \newpage\section*{Acknowledgments} followed by your text.

\newpage
\input{acknowledgments}

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

\input{abstract}

% Now you can include a preface. Again, use something like
% \newpage\section*{Preface} followed by your text

% Table of contents comes after preface
\tableofcontents

% If you have tables, uncomment the following line
\listoftables

% If you have figures, uncomment the following line
\newpage\listoffigures

% List of Abbrevs is NOT optional (Martha Wellman likes all abbrevs
% listed)
% For mathematics a list of symbols is perhaps more appropriate, but
% fulfills the same role
% If your list is longer than one page, use the ``longtable'' package
% Just \usepackage{longtable} and then replace the word ``tabular'' 
% with ``longtable''.  You may have to download this package from
% CTAN or another internet source.

% The back matter
% If you don't write the journal names out in full in the bibliography
% then you need a list of journal abbreviations
% If your list is longer than one page, use the ``longtable'' package
% Just \usepackage{longtable} and then replace the word ``tabular'' 
% with ``longtable''.  You may have to download this package from
% CTAN or another internet source.

% finally you must include your cv.  You can do that whatever way you
% like including by formatting it in a totally different program.

% If you would like to grab it from some other source then be sure the
% page numbering is consecutive with the end of the bibliography and
% be sure it appears on the table of contents by adding a line such as
%  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Curriculum Vitae}

% If you would like to include it directly you could use the commands
% in the below example

\chapter*{Curriculum Vitae}
