\end{figure}
The signal plus background model 
(described in detail in \sec\ref{sec:bg_estimates})
is compared to data at pre-selection, defined in \sec\ref{sec:preselection},
for a few different kinematic distributions 
in \fig\ref{fig:preselection}. In the upper plot of each distribution,
the colored histograms 
represent the different categories contributing to the signal 
plus background model and 
are split by color based on the category. 
%The colors are...
Hashed bands are shown on the stacked
histograms representing the size of the systematic uncertainties 
on the model, described in \sec\ref{sec:systematics}.
The data is shown in the black points where the 
bars on the points represent the statistical uncertainty on the data.
The lower plot shows the ratio of the data over the model.
In this case, the error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty
on the ratio due to both the data and the model. The red band
shows the size of the systematic uncertainties with respect to the model.
The model is said to be consistent with the data
if the ratio is consistent with unity after considering statistical
and systematic uncertainties.
The different distributions are chosen primarily because 
of their potential to discriminate between signal and background. 
From top to bottom and left to right,
these distributions are: the leading, subleading, and minimum lepton \pt~(ordered by their \pt),
\MET, \deltaphi, $m_{\textrm{SFOS}}$, \njet, \nbjet, and $N_{\mu}$.
In general, the signal plus background model is observed to be consistent
with the data at the pre-selection, at least for those distributions
considered here.

(discussed in section~\ref{sec:systematics}) are shown, 
namely from the fake estimates and the uncertainties on the WZ and ZZ k-factors.}
\label{fig:preselection_nsfos}
\end{figure}

Upon splitting the pre-selection region based on the number of SFOS
pairs, we end up with signal and background predictions like in 
\fig\ref{fig:preselection_nsfos}, where we can see differences
in the branching fraction for the signal to each of the three signal regions.
In the 0 and 2 SFOS regions, roughly 2.5 signal events are predicted
whereas closer to 5 signal events are predicted in the 1 SFOS region. 
Totaling about 10 signal events predicted at the pre-selection stage.
Shifting to looking at the background, perhaps the most striking 
feature of this plot is the 
clear difference in background yield and background composition
between the 0 SFOS region and the 1 and 2 SFOS regions.
More than 1000 background events are predicted in both the 1 and
the 2 SFOS regions, while only about 30 background events are
predicted in the 0 SFOS region.
Apparently then, the advantage of splitting the signal region based on this
classification comes when looking at the background, specifically the
electroweak $WZ$ and $ZZ$ backgrounds where SFOS lepton pairs may be
produced from the decay of the $Z$ boson(s). Consider only the case
where the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ decay to either $e$ or $\mu$.  The $WZ$ production
process is thus characterized by 3 leptons with at least 1 SFOS lepton pair
which comes from the $Z$. If all three leptons from the $WZ$ decay have been
reconstructed, then there is a 50~\% chance the third lepton 
will also be able to form a SFOS pair with one of the leptons from the $Z$ decay.
Thus, the WZ background will split evenly between the 1 and 2 SFOS classification.
Something similar occurs for the ZZ background except that the fourth lepton 
in the decay must be lost (usually due to possessing a low $\pt$).
The large cross-section for theses processes means that
they become the dominant backgrounds in the 1 and 2 SFOS regions.  
The 0 SFOS signal region is mostly spared from contamination  by 
these large processes but still
includes both the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ processes as background due to the
non-negligible (albeit small) effect of mis-measurement of the lepton
charge, see section~\ref{sec:charge_misid}.  The 0 SFOS signal region
is thus unique in having a small background which is almost entirely
reducible and dominated instead by events where a jet is mis-measured
as or overlaps with a lepton, called the fake lepton background, along
with the aforementioned sub-dominant effect of lepton charge 
mis-identification.

\subsection{Correction Factors and Fiducial Cross-sections}
\label{sec:inputs}

The correction factor, $C_i$, is defined for each channel, $i$,
as the ratio of the number of expected signal events measured
at the reconstruction level, $N_i^{\textrm{Reco}}$, over the number
expected from truth information, $N_i^{\textrm{Truth}}$.
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_i = \frac{N_i^{\textrm{Reco}}}{N_i^{\textrm{Truth}}}
\end{equation}
$N_i^{\textrm{Reco}}$ 
is determined using the reconstruction
level selection described in \sec\ref{sec:signal_regions} and
listed in \tab\ref{tab:signal_selection}
while $N_i^{\textrm{Truth}}$  is determined using the fiducial
selection described in \sec\ref{sec:fiducial} and 
listed in \tab\ref{tab:fiducial_selection}. The same generator, 
\vbfnlo, is used for both to remove any dependence on the 
cross-section or other generator specific effects.

The fiducial cross-sections are calculatd also using the selection
from the \sec\ref{sec:signal_regions} while weighting
to the cross-section for the given sample. Recall also 
from \sec\ref{sec:signal} and \tab\ref{tab:signal_xsec}
that the fiducial cross-sections were generated using
both \madgraph~and \vbfnlo~and were shown to be in good agreement.
The fiducial cross-sections from \madgraph~are used in the final
estimates.

\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\input{tables/LimitInputs_3l.tex}
\caption{Correction factors, $C_i$, and fiducial cross-sections dervied
separately for each signal region. Correction factors are determined
using \vbfnlo~while fiducial cross-sections are determined
using \madgraph.}
\label{tab:inputs_3l}
\end{table}

The correction factors and fiducial cross-sections are 
summarized separately for each signal region in 
\tab\ref{tab:inputs_3l}.
Note that the sum of the fiducial cross-sections
in each signal region gives the combined fiducial cross-section
which was reported in \eqn\ref{eq:fiducial_theory} along with 
PDF and scale uncertainties.
