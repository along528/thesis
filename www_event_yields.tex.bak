The signal plus background model 
(described in detail in \sec\ref{sec:bg_estimates})
is compared to data at pre-selection, defined in \sec\ref{sec:preselection},
for a few different kinematic distributions 
in \fig\ref{fig:preselection1} and \fig\ref{fig:preselection2}. 
In the upper plot of each distribution,
the colored histograms 
represent the different categories contributing to the signal 
plus background model and 
are split by color based on the category. 
%The colors are...
Hashed bands are shown on the stacked
histograms representing the size of the systematic uncertainties 
on the model, described later in \sec\ref{sec:systematics}.
The data is shown in the black points where the 
bars on the points represent the statistical uncertainty on the data.
The lower plot shows the ratio of the data over the model.
The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty
on the ratio due to both the data and the model. The red band
shows the size of the systematic uncertainties with respect to the model.
The model is said to be consistent with the data
if the ratio is compatible with unity after considering statistical
and systematic uncertainties.
The different distributions are chosen primarily because 
of their potential to discriminate between signal and background. 
The number of signal events at pre-selection is predicted to be 
$9.78 \pm 0.041 \stat ^{+0.390}_{0.447} \syst$
while the number of predicted background events is 
$2387.9 \pm 6.5 \stat ^{+297.8}_{-285.2} \syst$. 
This is consistent with the 2472 events observed in the data.

\end{figure}

Upon splitting the pre-selection region based on the number of SFOS
pairs, we end up with the signal and background predictions in
\fig\ref{fig:preselection_nsfos}, where we can see differences
in the branching fraction for the signal to fall into
each of the three signal regions.
In the 0 and 2 SFOS regions, roughly 2.5 signal events are predicted
whereas closer to 5 signal events are predicted in the 1 SFOS region.
Shifting to looking at the background, perhaps the most striking 
feature of this plot is the 
clear difference in background yield and background composition
between the 0 SFOS region and the 1 and 2 SFOS regions.
More than 1000 background events are predicted in both the 1 and
the 2 SFOS regions, but only about 30 background events are
predicted in the 0 SFOS region.
Clearly then, the advantage of splitting the signal region based on this
classification comes when looking at the background, specifically the
electroweak $WZ$ and $ZZ$ backgrounds where SFOS lepton pairs may be
produced from the decay of the $Z$ boson(s). Consider only the case
where the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ decay to either electrons or muons.  The $WZ$ production
process is thus characterized by 3 leptons with at least 1 SFOS lepton pair
that comes from the $Z$. If all three leptons from the $WZ$ decay have been
reconstructed, then there is a 50~\% chance the third lepton 
will also be able to form a SFOS pair with one of the leptons from the $Z$ decay.
Thus, the WZ background will split evenly between the 1 and 2 SFOS classification.
Something similar occurs for the ZZ background except that the fourth lepton 
in the decay must be lost (usually due to possessing a low $\pt$).
The large cross-section for these processes means that
they become the dominant backgrounds in the 1 and 2 SFOS regions.  
The 0 SFOS signal region is mostly spared from contamination  by 
these large processes but still
includes both the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ processes as background due to the
non-negligible (albeit small) effect of mis-measurement of the electron
charge described in \sec\ref{sec:charge_misid} and the presence
of leptonically decaying taus.  The 0 SFOS signal region
is thus unique in having a small background which is almost entirely
reducible and dominated instead by the fake background,
described in \sec\ref{sec:bg_fake},
along with contamination from $WZ$ and $ZZ$.

\subsection{Fiducial Cross-sections and Correction Factors}
\label{sec:inputs}

The SM signal predictions at reconstruction level 
are reported above in \sec\ref{sec:signal_yield}.
In anticipation of the SM cross-section measurement extraction
in \sec\ref{sec:measurement} and \sec\ref{sec:combined_measurement}, 
the number of expected signal events 
at reconstruction level, $N^{\textrm{Reco}}_i$, in signal region $i$,
are factorized such that
\begin{equation}
N^{\textrm{Reco}}_i = N^{\textrm{Fid}}_i \times C_i
\end{equation}
where $N^{\textrm{Fid}}_i$
is the number of events expected from the fiducial
level selection of \sec\ref{sec:fiducial} and 
$C_i$ is the ``correction factor'' which 
accounts for differences between the fiducial level prediction
and the reconstruction level prediction.
In practice, $N^{\textrm{Reco}}_i$ and $N^{\textrm{Fid}}_i$
are computed explicitly from the signal MC using the selections
in \tab\ref{tab:signal_selection} and \tab\ref{tab:fiducial_selection},
respectively.  The correction factor is then derived by the simple rearrangement
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cfactor}
C_i = \frac{N_i^{\textrm{Reco}}}{N_i^{\textrm{Fid}}}
\end{equation}
In this thesis, the numbers in the numerator and denominator are both derived for the SM
signal using the \vbfnlo~generator.


The number of predicted fiducial events, $N^{\textrm{Fid}}_i$,
can be interpreted as a fiducial cross-section, $\sigma^{\textrm{Fid}}_i$,
using the LHC integrated luminosity and \eqn\eqref{eq:lhc_nevents}.
Recall from \sec\ref{sec:signal} and \tab\ref{tab:signal_xsec}
that the fiducial cross-sections for the SM signal were generated using
both \madgraph~and \vbfnlo~and were shown to be in good agreement.
The fiducial cross-sections from \madgraph~are used in the final
estimates.


\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\input{tables/LimitInputs_3l.tex}
\caption{Correction factors, $C_i$, and fiducial cross-sections derived
separately for each signal region. Correction factors are determined
using \vbfnlo~; fiducial cross-sections are determined
using \madgraph.}
\label{tab:inputs_3l}
\end{table}

The values for the correction factors and fiducial cross-sections
in each signal region of \sec\ref{sec:signal_yield}
are reported in \tab\ref{tab:inputs_3l}.
Note that the sum of the fiducial cross-sections
in each signal region give the combined fiducial cross-section
which was reported in \eqn\ref{eq:fiducial_theory} along with 
PDF and scale uncertainties.



One important caveat about this framework is that the fiducial selection explicitly vetos for the presence of leptonically decaying $\tau$ leptons coming from the $W$, 
while for the reconstruction level selection no such veto is applied. 
This allows for a simple fiducial definition.
However, this also means that the correction factor will be inflated by the presence of 
events with leptonically decaying $\tau$ leptons passing the reconstruction
level selection. Studies of the $WWW$ signal MC suggest that this could be 
as high as 20\%. Bear in mind this is not corrected for explicitly in the interpretation
of \sec\ref{sec:measurement}.
